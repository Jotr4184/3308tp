It takes about eight hours for one of your cells to completely copy its DNA.


The human DNA code is made up of about three thousand million A,T, C, and Gs on each side of the DNA strand.


If you were to start reciting the order of the ATCGs in your DNA tomorrow morning, at a rate of 100 each minute, 57 years would pass before you reached the end (provided that you did not stop to eat, drink, sleep, use the bathroom etc.)


If you were to stretch out the DNA from those 46 chromosomes in one cell and lay it end to end, it would be over 2 yards in length.


If the total DNA in one person were laid in a straight line, it would stretch to the sun and back over 30 times (it’s 93 million miles from here to the sun). 


You could fit one thousand nuclei across the period at the end of this sentence.


You could fit one million threads of DNA across the period at the end of this sentence. 


If the genome was a book, it would be the equivalent of 800 dictionaries. It would take a person typing 60 words per minute, eight hours a day, around 50 years to type the human genome. You would need 3 gigabytes of storage space on a computer to hold all of this
