(Richard) - Make an app that utilizes Google Directions APIs <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/> to take incoming students on a guided tour of the campus.  It could take them to some of the major locations like the UMC, C4C, Norlin Library, etc.  To make it fun, we could add a (possibly simple) animated tour guide, or have the app "interrupt" the tour in order to take the student inside a popular coffee shop.
